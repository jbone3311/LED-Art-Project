Creating a James Turrell-inspired LED art installation using a Raspberry Pi is an exciting endeavor that merges art and technology. Below is a comprehensive blueprint for a beta version of the software, incorporating your requirements and suggestions:

---

## üé® Project Overview

**Objective:** Develop a web-based application hosted on a Raspberry Pi to control addressable LED strips, enabling the creation of dynamic light scenes inspired by James Turrell's work. The system should allow for:

* **Dynamic Color Control:** Including predefined Turrell-inspired palettes.
* **Adjustable Fade Durations:** From milliseconds to several minutes.
* **Multi-Segment Control:** Independently control different sections of the LED strip.
* **Scene Management:** Save and load custom light scenes.
* **Responsive Web Interface:** Accessible via desktop, iPad, and iPhone.
* **Local Network Access:** No authentication required, operating within a private LAN.

## üß† System Architecture

### 1. **Hardware Components**

* **Raspberry Pi (Model 3 or newer):** Acts as the central controller.
* **Addressable LED Strips (e.g., WS2812B):** Fully controllable via software.
* **Power Supply:** Adequate to power the LED strips.
* **Optional:** Level shifter for signal voltage matching.

### 2. **Software Stack**

* **Operating System:** Raspberry Pi OS (Lite version recommended for headless operation).
* **Web Server:** Flask (Python-based lightweight web framework).
* **LED Control Library:** rpi\_ws281x or similar for PWM control.
* **Frontend Framework:** Bootstrap for responsive design.
* **Data Storage:** JSON files for scene configurations.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Web Interface Features

### 1. **Dashboard**

* **Live Preview:** Visual representation of the LED strip's current state.
* **Global Controls:** Start/stop animations, adjust brightness.

### 2. **Scene Editor**

* **Color Selection:** Choose from predefined Turrell-inspired palettes or custom colors.
* **Fade Duration:** Set transition times between colors.
* **Segment Control:** Divide the LED strip into multiple segments, each with independent settings.
* **Animation Patterns:** Options like static, fade, blink, and custom sequences.

### 3. **Scene Management**

* **Save Scenes:** Store custom configurations with descriptive names.
* **Load Scenes:** Retrieve and apply saved configurations.
* **Delete Scenes:** Remove unwanted scenes from storage.

### 4. **Settings**

* **LED Strip Configuration:** Set the number of LEDs and segment divisions.
* **Network Settings:** Display IP address and network status.

---

## üé® Turrell-Inspired Color Palettes

Incorporate color schemes inspired by James Turrell's installations, such as:

* **Skyspace Series:** Soft blues, purples, and pinks.
* **Roden Crater:** Earthy reds and oranges.
* **Ganzfeld Pieces:** Gradual transitions between complementary colors.

These palettes can be predefined in the system for easy access.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan

### 1. **Setup Raspberry Pi**

* Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite.
* Enable SSH for remote access.
* Update system packages.

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install flask rpi_ws281x
```

### 3. **Configure LED Control**

* Connect the LED strip to the Raspberry Pi GPIO.
* Use the rpi\_ws281x library to control the LEDs.

### 4. **Develop Flask Web Application**

* Create routes for dashboard, scene editor, and settings.
* Implement API endpoints for real-time control.

### 5. **Design Frontend Interface**

* Use Bootstrap to ensure responsiveness across devices.
* Implement JavaScript for dynamic interactions.

### 6. **Implement Scene Management**

* Store scene configurations in JSON files.
* Provide options to save, load, and delete scenes via the web interface.

## üìÑ Sample Code Snippet

Here's a basic example of controlling the LED strip using Python:

```python
from rpi_ws281x import PixelStrip, Color

# LED strip configuration:
LED_COUNT = 60        # Number of LED pixels.
LED_PIN = 18          # GPIO pin connected to the pixels (must support PWM).

# Create PixelStrip object
strip = PixelStrip(LED_COUNT, LED_PIN)
strip.begin()

# Function to set color
def set_color(color):
    for i in range(strip.numPixels()):
        strip.setPixelColor(i, Color(*color))
    strip.show()
```

This function can be expanded to include fade effects and segment control.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

* **Audio Reactive Modes:** Sync light patterns with music.
* **Scheduling:** Automate scene changes based on time.
* **Remote Access:** Securely control the system over the internet.
* **User Authentication:** Add login functionality for multi-user environments.
